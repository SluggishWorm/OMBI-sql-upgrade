After having quite a bit of frustration migrating Ombi to MySQL
Since none addressed Docker clearly, especially within Unraid, I figured I'd post what I used to get it to work.
This was with the linuxserver Ombi docker.


# Create your Ombi DB's in MySQL, applying a user permissions (I used u:ombi p:ombi to simplify):
# DB's:
# - Ombi
# - Ombi_External
# - Ombi_Settings

# Place the 'ombi_sqlite2mysql.py' file in the root Ombi appdata folder:

# SSH into Unraid and enter the Ombi docker with:
docker exec -it ombi /bin/bash

# Install python:
apt update; apt install python3 python3-mysqldb -y;

# Run command to create tables in DB:
/app/ombi/Ombi --migrate

# Move to config directory (Ombi appdata folder):
cd config

# Run command to create migration json (unsure if this step was necessary but I followed it):
python3 ombi_sqlite2mysql.py -c /config --only_manager_json

# And finally migrate (with --host being your MySQL docker IP and the credentials created above when creating the DB's):
python3 ombi_sqlite2mysql.py -c /config --host 192.168.1.20 --user ombi --passwd ombi

After which you should be able to restart Ombi and be able to log in as if all was the same, just snappier. 
The Python libraries are only required for migration, so updates shouldnt break it
